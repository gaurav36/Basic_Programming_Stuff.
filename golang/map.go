/* Map: hashes or dicts in other language
 * [1]. To create an empty map, use the builtin make: make(map[key-type]val-type).
 * [2]. Set key/value pairs using typical name[key] = val syntax.
 * [3]. The optional second return value when getting a value from a map
 *      indicates if the key was present in the map. This can be used to
 *      disambiguate between missing keys and keys with zero values like 0
 *      or "". Here we didnâ€™t need the value itself, so we ignored it with
 *      the blank identifier _,
 * [4]. You can also declare and initialize a new map in the same line with
 *      this syntax.
