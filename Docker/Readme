Palying with docker:

* You should have makefusedev.sh, supervisord.conf, Dockerfile in Docker
  directory.

* You can use few docker alias which present in "helpful_alias" file
  in your .bashrc file.

* If you are using docker first time then you need to first pull docker image
  by doing:
 
  # docker build -t <image name> <Path of the Docker file>

  for eg: 
  <suppose i am in directory where docker file present>
  execute:

  # docker build -t <ggarg/***dev> .


  after that docker image will be pulled from docker hub. you can see it
  by executing

  # docker images

  for running docker execute

  # docker run -i -t <docker image>

  or you can use helpful_alias shortcut for running docker. if you have
  paste all alias from helpful_alias then you can see ip address of all
  running docker container by executing

  # dips

  Above command will give you list of all docker container ID with respective
  ip address.

  For login to that container do
  ssh root@ip_address
  and enter password is:  password
