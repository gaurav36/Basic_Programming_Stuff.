Observation:
===========
Containers need to be run with --previleged=true to ensure setxattr works
docker containers do not allow to edit /etc/hosts file. Docker mounts an
/etc/hosts file inside it's containers, read-only, and the container's 'root'
user has had it's mount permissions revoked so it's not able to be modified.
